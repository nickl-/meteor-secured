## Meteor taken out for a spin

[Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/main), an ultra-simple, database-everywhere, data-on-the-wire, pure-Javascript web framework.

Better described by their 7 principles:

## Seven Principles of Meteor

 * Data on the Wire. Don't send HTML over the network. Send data and let the client decide how to render it.
 * One Language. Write both the client and the server parts of your interface in JavaScript.
 * Database Everywhere. Use the same transparent API to access your database from the client or the server.
 * Latency Compensation. On the client, use prefetching and model simulation to make it look like you have a zero-latency connection to the database.
 * Full Stack Reactivity. Make realtime the default. All layers, from database to template, should make an event-driven interface available.
 * Embrace the Ecosystem. Meteor is open source and integrates, rather than replaces, existing open source tools and frameworks.
 * Simplicity Equals Productivity. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. Accomplish this through clean, classically beautiful APIs.
